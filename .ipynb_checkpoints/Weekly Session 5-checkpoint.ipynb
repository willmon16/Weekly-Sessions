We will then explore the idea of extrapolating to a more accurate answer - Romberg integration is an example of the more general approach of Richardson extrapolation, which is also applied in other contexts (in particular, solution of differential equations).\n",

If your code must calculate millions of integrals (or even just hundreds of integrals), and you need a certain accuracy, it is simply impractical for you to intervene and hand-pick the number of steps for each integral.
