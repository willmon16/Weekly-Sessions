We will then explore the idea of extrapolating to a more accurate answer - Romberg integration is an example of the more general approach of Richardson extrapolation, which is also applied in other contexts (in particular, solution of differential equations).\n",

If your code must calculate millions of integrals (or even just hundreds of integrals), and you need a certain accuracy, it is simply impractical for you to intervene and hand-pick the number of steps for each integral.  You could just choose a \"really big'' number of steps for all integrals, even when they are not needed, but this will make your code impractically slow (perhaps factors of hundreds slower than it needs to be).\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, let us see how how much of an improvement this gives. Suppose we ultimately need, say, $2^{5}$ steps.  How many times would we have to evaluate $f$ if we evaluated the integral from scratch with each iteration ($1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, $\\ldots$ steps)?  How many times would we have to evaluate $f$ if we reused the prior integrals, instead?"
