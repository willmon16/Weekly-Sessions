    "\n",
    "Controlling the flow of a program is arguably the most important aspect of computer programming, and what makes programs so good at solving repetative problems. If you face a problem where the solution involves doing the same operation many times or on many objects, then a computer program is a great way to solve your problem. Python has three major control structures: _If_, _While_, and _For_.  We are going to explore first logical instructions, which are the manner in which we  \"control\" these structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "All the arithmetic expressions we have seen so far combined *numbers* to get a new *number*.  We will have just as much need for expressions which result in a *logical* value, ```False``` or ```True```.   Logical expressions are needed whenever we have to make a decision which controls the \"flow'' of the program, *e.g.*, in an ```if``` or a ```while.``` There are two types of operators which return logical values: *comparison* operators (which test for the relation between numbers) and *logical operators*  from Boolean algebra. Let see how these operators work by taking the examples from Newman page 41, and understanding what they mean as *expressions*.\n",
